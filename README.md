# Image Style Transfer using Machine Learning
A deep learning project that applies artistic styles to images using neural style transfer. Combines CNNs with machine learning classifiers for performance analysis.# Image Style Transfer using Machine Learning

A B.Tech project that explores **image style transfer**—applying the artistic style of one image to another using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## 🔍 Overview

- Transfers image style while preserving content using CNNs and GANs.
- Compares performance of classifiers: **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, and **XGBoost**.
- Uses TensorFlow Hub for neural style transfer.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub  
- XGBoost, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, NumPy, PIL

## 📦 Features

- Style & content extraction
- Classifier comparison for performance analysis
- Real-time image stylization demo

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python style_transfer.py
